# Data-Analysis---SQL

Project Overview:
The project encompasses an extensive SQL-based inventory and sales management system. It incorporates database creation, 
table design, data population, and complex queries to analyze inventory, sales, store-wise insights, product metrics, and inventory valuation across multiple dimensions.

Key Project Highlights:

Database Creation and Table Design:
The project initiated with the creation of a SQL Server database featuring multiple tables, including Categories, Brands, Products, Stocks, 
Customers, Stores, Orders, and Order_Items. Each table was carefully designed with primary and foreign keys to establish coherent relationships between entities.

Data Population and Management:
Datasets were populated into respective tables using BULK INSERT operations. Dummy data was imported from CSV files into tables such as Brands, 
Categories, Customers, Order_Items, Orders, Products, and Stores.

SQL Queries and Data Analysis:
A series of complex SQL queries were devised to extract insightful information from the database. 
Queries encompassed a wide range of analyses, including inventory price and value, category-wise inventory quantity and value, 
brand-wise quantity and inventory value, total inventory statistics, store-wise inventory percentages, total sales, store-wise sales contribution, and top-selling products.
